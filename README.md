# at_testing_app
On the USSD open source , I have managed to create an at_testing application, which have added the AT elixir wrapper as a dependency, then generated a callback url that AT can use to communicate with the at_testing application. The purpose of the at_testing application is to enable me to test the ussd functionality from the elixir wrapper
